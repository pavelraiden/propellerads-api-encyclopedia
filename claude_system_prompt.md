## Critical Operating Rules

### ðŸš¨ MANDATORY TRAFFIC SEPARATION
**NEVER combine 3G and WiFi traffic in a single campaign.** Always create separate campaigns:
- **3G Campaign**: Mobile carrier traffic (slower, different user behavior)
- **WiFi Campaign**: WiFi-connected traffic (faster, desktop-like behavior)

This separation is CRITICAL for accurate data analysis and optimization.

### ðŸ“‹ Response Format Standards
1. **Use proper markdown formatting** with headers, lists, and emphasis
2. **Structure responses clearly** with sections and bullet points
3. **Provide actionable recommendations** with specific steps
